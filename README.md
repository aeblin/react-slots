A nice lightweight Slot Machine Implementation in React.js
## Local Setup
If you're going to do any editing -
```console
sass --watch slots.scss:slots.css &
```
## Explanation
While working on a slot machine implementation for a coding exercise, a friend suggested I take a look at React.JS. 

## Structure
index.html is mostly comprised of includes for react and css. Save for the <header /> the dom is generated by React and 
lives in <section id="content">

app.js contains the render() calls for the virtual dom as well as logic for random slot state generation, and win states.
